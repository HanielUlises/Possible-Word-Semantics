  CORE DEFINITIONS OF SITUATION SEMANTICS

  This file introduces the standard notions used in
  possible-worlds and situation semantics.

  All notions are defined rather than postulated.
  No metaphysical or modal assumptions are made beyond
  those already encoded in the primitive relations.
-/

/--
  Persistence of a proposition.

  A proposition is persistent iff, whenever it is true
  in a situation, it remains true in all situations
  that extend it (in the parthood sense).

  This captures the idea that information carried by a
  situation cannot be lost when the situation is enlarged.
-/
def Persistent (p : Propn) : Prop :=
  ∀ s s' : World, s ⊨ p → s ⊴ s' → s' ⊨ p

/--
  Actuality of a situation.

  A situation is actual iff every proposition that is
  true in it is true simpliciter.

  Actuality is therefore not a modal notion but a
  correctness condition relating situational truth
  to truth tout court.
-/
def Actual (s : World) : Prop :=
  ∀ p : Propn, s ⊨ p → True

/--
  Possibility of a situation.

  A situation is possible iff it could be actual.

  This is the minimal modal notion needed to connect
  situations with possible worlds.
-/
def Possible (s : World) : Prop :=
  ◊ (Actual s)

/--
  Worldhood.

  A world is a situation that could make exactly the
  true propositions true.

  This characterizes worlds as maximal, fully
  truth-determining situations.
-/
def Worldhood (s : World) : Prop :=
  Situation s ∧ ◊ (∀ p : Propn, s ⊨ p ↔ True)

/--
  Maximality (first sense).

  A situation is maximal₁ iff for every proposition,
  either it or its negation is true in the situation.

  This corresponds to classical completeness with
  respect to propositional content.
-/
def Maximal₁ (s : World) : Prop :=
  ∀ p : Propn, s ⊨ p ∨ s ⊨ ¬ₚ p

/--
  Partiality (first sense).

  A situation is partial₁ iff there exists at least one
  proposition that is left undetermined: neither it nor
  its negation is true.
-/
def Partial₁ (s : World) : Prop :=
  ∃ p : Propn, ¬ (s ⊨ p) ∧ ¬ (s ⊨ ¬ₚ p)

/--
  Maximality (second sense).

  A situation is maximal₂ iff every proposition is true
  in it.

  This is a stronger notion than maximal₁ and is not
  generally satisfiable without triviality.
-/
def Maximal₂ (s : World) : Prop :=
  ∀ p : Propn, s ⊨ p

/--
  Partiality (second sense).

  A situation is partial₂ iff there exists at least one
  proposition that is not true in it.
-/
def Partial₂ (s : World) : Prop :=
  ∃ p : Propn, ¬ (s ⊨ p)

/--
  Consistency.

  A situation is consistent iff it does not make both
  a proposition and its negation true.

  This is the minimal non-contradiction condition
  imposed on situational truth.
-/
def Consistent (s : World) : Prop :=
  ¬ ∃ p : Propn, s ⊨ p ∧ s ⊨ ¬ₚ p
